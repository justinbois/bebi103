    .. deprecated:: 0.0.23
          `approx_hess` will be removed in in version 1.0.0.
          Use `statsmodels.tools.numdiff.approx_hess3`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       value at which function derivative is evaluated
    f : function
       function of one array f(x, `*args`, `**kwargs`)
    epsilon : float or array-like, optional
       Stepsize used, if None, then stepsize is automatically chosen
       according to EPS**(1/4)*x.
    args : tuple
        Arguments for function `f`.
    kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments for function `f`.


    Returns
    -------
    hess : ndarray
       array of partial second derivatives, Hessian


    Notes
    -----
    Equation (9) in Ridout. Computes the Hessian as::

      1/(4*d_j*d_k) * ((f(x + d[j]*e[j] + d[k]*e[k]) - f(x + d[j]*e[j]
                                                     - d[k]*e[k])) -
                 (f(x - d[j]*e[j] + d[k]*e[k]) - f(x - d[j]*e[j]
                                                     - d[k]*e[k]))

    where e[j] is a vector with element j == 1 and the rest are zero and
    d[i] is epsilon[i].
