    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) is a way to combine text (with math!) and code (which runs and can display graphic output!) in an easy-to-read document that renders in a web browser.  The notebook itself is stored as a text file in [JSON](http://json.org) format.  This text file is what you will email the course staff when submitting your homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is language agnostic as its name suggests.  The name \"Jupyter\" is a combination of [Julia](http://julialang.org/) (a new language for scientific computing), [Python](http://python.org/) (which you know and love, or at least will when the course is over), and [R](https://www.r-project.org) (the dominant tool for statistical computation).  However, you currently can run over 40 different languages in a Jupyter notebook, not just Julia, Python, and R."

Otherwise, you can can hit `esc` and then `y` (denoted \"`esc, y`\") while a cell is selected to specify that it is a code cell.  Note that you will have to hit enter after doing this to start editing it.\n",

    "If you want to execute the code in a code cell, hit \"`shift + enter`.\"  Note that code cells are executed in the order you execute them.  That is to say, the ordering of the cells for which you hit \"`shift + enter`\" is the order in which the code is executed.  If you did not explicitly execute a cell early in the document, its results are now known to the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells contain text.  The text is written in **markdown**, a lightweight markup language.  You can read about its syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  Note that you can also insert HTML into markdown cells, and this will be rendered properly.  As you are typing the contents of these cells, the results appear as text.  Hitting \"`shift + enter`\" renders the text in the formatting you specify.\n",
    "\n",

    "In general, when you want to add a new cell, you can use the \"Insert\" pulldown menu from the Jupyter toolbar.  The shortcut to insert a cell below is \"`esc, b`\" and to insert a cell above is \"`esc, a`.\"  Alternatively, you  can execute a cell and automatically add a new one below it by hitting \"`alt + enter`.\""

    "When displaying graphics, you should have them **inline**, meaning that they are displayed directly in the IPython notebook and not in a separate window.  You can specify that, as I did at the top of this document, using the `%matplotlib inline` magic function.  Below is an example of graphics displayed inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, I prefer presenting graphics as scalable vector graphics (SVG).  Vector graphics are infinitely zoom-able; i.e., the graphics are represented as points, lines, curves, etc., in space, not as a set of pixel values as is the case with raster graphics (such as PNG).  By default, graphics are displayed as PNGs, but you can specify SVG as I have at the top of this document in the first code cell.  Unfortunately, there seems to be a bug, as least when I render in Safari, where vertical and horizontal lines are not properly rendered when using SVG.  For some reason, when I select next cell and convert it to a code cell and back to markdown, the lines are then properly rendered.  This is annoying, but I tend to think it is worth it to have nice SVG graphics.  On the other hand, PNG graphics will usually suffice if you want to use them in your homework."

The list of syntactical constructions at [this link](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) are pretty much all you need to know for standard markdown.

Hitting \"`shift + enter`\" renders the text in the formatting you specify.\n",

This is run off of a remote server, so if you are not connected to the internet, your equations will not be rendered.  You will use $\\LaTeX$ extensively in preparation of your assignments.  There are plenty of resources on the internet for getting started with $\\LaTeX$, but you will only need a tiny subset of its functionality in your assignments, and this tutorial, plus cheat sheets you may find by Google (such as [this one](http://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf)) are useful."
